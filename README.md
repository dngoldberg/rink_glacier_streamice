# rink_glacier_streamice
A set of input files, shell scripts of code to manage the simulation of a section of western greenland with MITgcm/STREAMICE

**The Repository is organised as follows:**
- **code** folder: A set of files that are needed in order to compile MITgcm in order to use the STREAMICE package.
- **input** folder: A set of text input files to be read by MITgcm at runtime, as well as matlab files which are used to create binary inputs
- **archer_scripts** folder: A set of files helpful for use on the ARCHER2 supercomputer (*Not intended for use at UT*)
- **ls6_scripts** folder: A set of files provided by An Nguyen to enable use on the Lonestar6 supercomputer (*in progress*)

**Note: this readme is a placeholder for a more extensive wiki that will evolve over time.**
